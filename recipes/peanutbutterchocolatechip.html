        <h3>Discription</h3>
            <p>Why have just regular chocolate chip cookies when you can have <em>peanut butter</em> chocolate chip cookies?! These are chewy and delicious both out of the oven and many days later. They might have a little extra work (the chilling) but they are totally worth it!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (190g) bread flour</li>
                <li>1 cup (150g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon (7g) baking soda</li>
                <li>1 cup (240g) creamy peanut butter</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (170g or 1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup (200g) lightly packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon (6g) kosher salt </li>
                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 cups (326g) chocolate chips (dark, semi-sweet, or milk chocolate)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the dry ingredients
                    <p>In a small mixing bowl, use a spoon or whisk to combine the bread flour, all-purpose flour, and the baking soda. Set the bowl aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Blend the butters and sugar in a mixer
                    <p>To the bowl of your stand mixer, add the peanut butter, unsalted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and kosher salt. Using the paddle attachment, begin blending the butters and sugars together at low speed (#1 on a KitchenAid mixer).</p>
                    <p>After 30 seconds of blending on low speed, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle.</p>
                    <p>Start blending the mixture together again, this time on medium-low speed (#3 on a KitchenAid mixer) for 1 minute and 30 seconds. The mixture should look like a thick paste at this point. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Add in the eggs, one at a time
                    <p>Reduce the mixer speed to low and carefully add one egg into the bowl. Beat the egg into the butter-sugar mixture for 30 seconds. Once the egg is fully incorporated, add the other egg to the mixer and blend it in for another 30 seconds.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Scrape the bowl and add vanilla extract
                    <p>Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl and paddle once again. Add the vanilla extract to the mixture and turn the mixer back onto low (#2 on the KitchenAid mixer). Blend the ingredients for an additional minute. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Add the dry ingredients and the chocolate chips
                    <p>Stop the mixer, scrape down the bowl and paddle, then add all of the dry mixture to the bowl. Begin blending the dough at low speed (#1 on a KitchenAid mixer). After 30 seconds of mixing, start sprinkling in the chocolate chips. </p>
                    <p>After all of the chocolate chips have been added, stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl and paddle. Return the dough to the second speed on the Kitchen Aid for another minute.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Refrigerate cookie dough
                    <p>Once mixed, cover the bowl with a lid, plastic wrap or foil, and refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes (or up to 3 days). Even if you plan to freeze the dough later, chilling the dough for 30 minutes makes scooping it easier. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven and prepare baking sheets
                    <p>Ten minutes before the chilling time is finished, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Portion the dough
                    <p>After the dough has chilled, use a 2 or 3-ounce portion scoop or a lightly greased 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop the dough into balls. Place scooped cookie dough at least 1/2 inch apart to allow for slight spreading while they bake. Nine cookie portions should be able to fit on each baking sheet</p>
                </li>
                <li>Bake the cookies
                    <p>You will bake each batch of cookies in the oven separately. Bake the first sheet pan of cookies for 12 minutes, turning the pan halfway through baking (after 6 minutes) to ensure even browning.</p>
                    <p>After baking, remove the pan of cookies from the oven and allow them to sit on the pan for an additional 3 minutes to carryover bake. The cookies will have browned edges but will still look glossy in the center. They will continue to bake and set up as they cool. </p>
                    <p>Bake the next sheet pan of cookies as you did the first, turning mid-way through baking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Cook cookies on cooling rack
                    <p>Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely or enjoy them while still warm. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Storage
                    <p>Store leftover cookies in an air-tight container at room temperature for 4 days or freeze for up to 2 months. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
